Welcome to my submission for Task 3 of the Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech. In this task, I built a decision tree model to predict whether a customer will purchase a product/service using the bank marketing dataset.  

## Introduction
The bank marketing dataset contains information on marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The data includes various attributes such as age, job, marital status, and more, which can be used to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit.  

## Dataset
The dataset used for this task can be found in the repository.  

## Tools and Libraries
For this task, I used the following tools and libraries:  

-**Python**: For data manipulation and analysis.  
-**Pandas**: For data cleaning and preprocessing.  
-**NumPy**: For numerical operations.  
-**Scikit-learn**: For building the decision tree model.  
-**Matplotlib and Seaborn**: For data visualization.  
-**Jupyter Notebook**: For documenting the analysis and visualizations.  

## Data Cleaning
- Handled missing values by imputing or dropping them as necessary.  
- Converted categorical variables to numerical formats for modeling.  
- Removed any inconsistencies in the data.

## Evaluation Metrics
Accuracy: 89%
